A 2D platformer inspired by Jump King, I tried to develop.

I was very inspired by the game Jump King and Super Mario Maker at the time of this project. My idea was to expand on the mechanics of Jump King, and also add a larger world with puzzles and enemies.

I remember designing this game with a close friend of mine at the time, but as we grew distant, so did my motivation for working on the project.

I still have fond memories of showing my other friends the incremental progress I made my IT programming class.

Here is a screenshot of the prototype project:

Unfortunately it seems the original Unity files for this project are lost. However I still have some of the assets and builds I showed my friends. Peruse at your own leisure.
